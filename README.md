reaperMarker will be an crowdsourced chapter tool for [reaper](http://reaper.fm/). If you do podcasts and you do live shows an you offer an IRC Chat you can ask your listeners to create chapter marks for you. When someone starts a message with "#marker" your current reaper recording will get a new marker with this marker. Afterwards you can review, edit and delete these markers with the built in Reaper tools.
